**AI-Based-Legal-Document-Summarization**

**Blog post:** https://medium.com/@dharanp1/ai-based-legal-document-summarization-7b24250572aa

**Problem Statement:**
Legal professionals often spend significant time reading and analyzing lengthy legal documents, case laws, contracts, and court decisions. These documents are complex, full of technical jargon, and contain crucial information scattered throughout. Manually extracting key clauses, decisions, and legal arguments is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project seeks to address this issue by developing an AI-based solution that can automatically summarize long legal documents, focusing on the most important legal information.

**Project Objectives:**
1.	Develop an AI-based Summarization System:
 o	Build a machine learning model that can condense long legal documents into concise summaries while preserving key information, such as legal arguments, clauses, and decisions.
2.	Leverage Advanced NLP Techniques:
 o	Utilize transformer-based models like BERT or GPT to enhance the model's ability to understand and summarize complex legal text.
 o	Implement text summarization techniques to generate human-readable summaries.
3.	Enhance Information Extraction:
 o	Incorporate Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify key legal entities, such as parties, legal statutes, and dates, to enrich the summaries and provide contextual relevance.

**Analysis Overview:**
•	Dataset Analysis: The dataset comprises Indian Supreme Court judgments and is structured to support abstractive summarization tasks. The documents are rich in legal jargon and structured hierarchically, making them suitable for testing transformer-based NLP models.
•	Model Analysis: Use transformer models such as BERT, GPT, or other legal-specific NLP models to generate summaries. We will evaluate their performance in capturing key legal points and their accuracy in maintaining the integrity of the legal language.
•	Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) and BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy). Additionally, human experts (lawyers) will assess the relevance and accuracy of the generated summaries.

**Expected Outcomes:**
•	Efficient Legal Document Summarization: The final model will produce concise, accurate, and relevant summaries of long legal documents, helping legal professionals save time and effort in document analysis.
•	Reduction in Manual Effort: Legal teams will be able to quickly understand case details, legal arguments, and outcomes, reducing the need for manual reading and analysis.
•	Scalable Solution: The system will be scalable, capable of handling various legal documents across different jurisdictions and languages.

**Literature Review:**

Research on automatic summarization techniques, particularly within the legal domain, has significantly advanced over the past decades. Early approaches to text summarization primarily utilized extractive methods, which identify and extract significant portions of a document, while abstractive summarization techniques attempt to generate novel sentences that convey the core ideas of the source text. Extractive summarization is relatively easier to implement but often lacks coherence compared to abstractive methods, which are more computationally demanding and complex (Chen and Bansal, 2018).

One of the foundational methods in text summarization is Topic Modelling and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which explore the hidden thematic structures within the text (Allahyari et al., 2017). These methods rely heavily on the underlying linguistic structures of the documents. Another common approach is based on graph-based methods, which use algorithms like TF-IDF to weigh sentence importance and represent the text as a network of interrelated sentences. Classical machine learning models are then used to determine the significance of each sentence (Saravanan et al., 2008).

Legal text summarization, a subfield that has attracted attention in recent years, presents its own unique challenges due to the complex structure and domain-specific language of legal documents. Existing methods for legal text summarization tend to focus on extractive summarization due to the scarcity of labeled datasets and the intricate nature of legal text. These methods are often supervised, requiring labeled data for training. However, in legal domains, labeled data is scarce, leading researchers to explore semi-supervised and unsupervised methods (Wagh and Anand, 2020).

Recent advancements in deep learning have revolutionized text summarization techniques, particularly in domains with unstructured data, such as legal texts. Research efforts have shifted towards leveraging neural networks and sentence embeddings to capture the semantics of text without relying on domain-specific features or hand-engineered labels. Sinha et al. (2018) and Young et al. (2018) demonstrated the effectiveness of multi-layer neural networks and complex architectures like LSTMs for text summarization. These models significantly outperform traditional machine learning approaches in terms of generating coherent and concise summaries (Kanapala et al., 2019).

In the legal domain, several approaches have been proposed. For instance, Kim et al. (2012) used an asymmetric weighted graph where sentences are treated as nodes, and those with higher weights are selected for the summary. Saravanan et al. (2008) applied a method based on rhetorical role identification, dividing legal documents into segments to identify the most important sections. This segmentation technique has also been explored in works by Yamada et al. (2017), where different granularities within a judgment are annotated to identify key text components.

More recent works, such as Kasture et al. (2014), have proposed ontology-based approaches for summarization, and Kavila et al. (2013) developed a hybrid system combining keyphrase matching and case-based methods for legal document summarization. The use of sentence embeddings like InferSent and Sent2Vec is gaining traction in the legal text summarization domain as these embeddings effectively capture sentence-level semantics and improve the extraction of relevant text portions (Conneau et al., 2017; Pagliardini et al., 2017).

The need for accurate, concise legal summaries has spurred interest in unsupervised and semi-supervised techniques. Oufaida et al. (2014) explored the use of discriminant analysis for multi-document summarization of Arabic texts. Meanwhile, Venkatesh (2013) applied hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (hLDA) to cluster legal judgments and generate summaries based on thematic similarity. Seth et al. (2016) proposed a simpler method using TF-IDF scores to rank sentences and select the most important ones.

With the increased availability of deep learning models and pre-trained embeddings, deep learning-based summarization is becoming the dominant approach. These models not only outperform traditional methods but also remove the dependency on domain expertise, making them adaptable to different legal systems and document formats.

The studies reviewed provide significant insights into the methodologies and challenges involved in legal text summarization, particularly in the context of extractive and abstractive summarization. A key takeaway from these works is the persistent challenge of dealing with the unavailability of labeled datasets, which has led to reliance on unsupervised or semi-supervised methods, such as topic modeling, LSA, and graph-based approaches. However, the shift toward deep learning-based techniques demonstrates a clear improvement in handling the complexity and high dimensionality of legal texts.

From the findings of studies like Sinha et al. (2018) and Young et al. (2018), it is clear that deep learning models, particularly those that utilize sentence embeddings (e.g., InferSent, Sent2Vec), outperform traditional methods due to their ability to capture the underlying semantics of sentences. Graph-based methods and classical machine learning models, such as TF-IDF-based systems, while effective for simpler domains, are often inadequate for the legal domain where sentences are longer and more complex.

Research by Saravanan et al. (2008) and Yamada et al. (2017), which focuses on rhetorical role identification and text segmentation, emphasizes the importance of considering the structure of legal texts. Abstractive summarization, although more sophisticated, often requires large-scale labeled data for training, which can be computationally expensive and difficult to acquire in the legal domain.

**Analysis:**
Scope: Implements summarization techniques for legal documents using extractive and abstractive methods.

Key Features:
1.	Summarization Techniques:
•	Extractive Methods: These models identify and extract key sentences directly from the source text. Techniques such as SummaRuNNer rely on machine learning to rank sentences based on importance, using features like word frequency and sentence position.

**Training:**
There were 3 Models variations were use:
•	BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers)
•	BERT  (Bbidirectional encoder representations from Transformers)
•	BERT RR

The primary objective of this notebook is to fine-tune the BART model for a specific Natural Language Processing (NLP) task. BART, a sequence-to-sequence model by Facebook AI, is particularly powerful for text generation tasks such as summarization, translation, and creative text generation. This process involves adapting a pre-trained model to a downstream task using supervised fine-tuning.

Key goals include:
•	Preparing data effectively for training and evaluation.
•	Customizing and optimizing the BART model for the target task.
•	Evaluating the fine-tuned model's performance using task-specific metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE.
•	Understanding the challenges and nuances of fine-tuning large transformer-based models.

**Process Overview**
2.1 Data Preparation

Dataset Selection and Loading:
•	The notebook uses a dataset where each entry consists of an input-output text pair. For instance, in text summarization, the input might be a full article, while the output is its concise summary.
•	Data is loaded into a structured format, either directly from files (e.g., CSV or JSON) or through APIs for benchmark datasets like CNN/DailyMail or Gigaword.

Preprocessing:
•	Text is cleaned to ensure uniformity and consistency. This might involve:
o	Removing unnecessary characters or whitespace.
o	Lowercasing or standardizing text formats.
o	Handling missing or corrupt data entries.

Tokenization:

o	Enable batching and shuffling for efficient training through DataLoader.

**2.2 Model Setup**

Pre-trained BART Model:
•	The BART model, available in variations such as facebook/bart-base or facebook/bart-large, is imported from the Hugging Face transformers library. These models are pre-trained on large corpora to understand language patterns, making them well-suited for fine-tuning.
Fine-tuning for Task:
•	Fine-tuning adjusts the model weights for a specific task. It adapts the general language understanding of BART to specific input-output mappings.
o	The decoder is tasked with generating sequences based on encoded representations of the input.
Loss Function:
•	The model uses the CrossEntropyLoss, calculated between predicted token probabilities and actual tokens from the target sequences. This loss penalizes incorrect predictions and guides model optimization.
2.3 Training Configuration
Hyperparameters:

•	Epochs: The number of complete passes through the dataset. Training for sufficient epochs ensures the model learns effectively without overfitting.
Optimizer:
•	The AdamW optimizer is employed for weight updates. It improves upon traditional Adam optimization by incorporating weight decay to mitigate overfitting.
Learning Rate Scheduler:
•	A scheduler dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on training progress. For example:
o	Warm-up phases during initial epochs to prevent drastic updates.
o	Gradual decay in later stages to fine-tune model parameters.
Training Loop:
•	The training loop processes batches of data, calculates gradients, and updates model weights iteratively. Key elements include:
o	Forward pass: The model predicts outputs for a batch of inputs.
o	Loss calculation: The difference between predicted and actual outputs.
o	Backward pass: Gradients are computed and propagated through the model.
o	Optimization: Model weights are updated based on gradients.

**2.4 Evaluation**
Validation Loop:
•	After each epoch, the model is evaluated on a validation set. This step:
o	Prevents overfitting by monitoring performance on unseen data.
o	Provides insights into generalization ability.
Metrics:
•	BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy):

Performance Tracking:
•	Plots of loss, BLEU, or ROUGE scores across epochs visualize training progress and highlight potential overfitting or underfitting issues.
3. Algorithms and Techniques
Sequence-to-Sequence Learning:
•	BART is inherently a sequence-to-sequence model. It takes an input sequence, encodes it into a latent representation, and decodes it into an output sequence.
Denoising Autoencoder:
•	BART is pre-trained to reconstruct original text from corrupted inputs. Corruption techniques include:
o	Token masking: Hiding specific tokens.
o	Token deletion or swapping: Altering sequence order.
o	Sentence shuffling: Disrupting sentence coherence.
Attention Mechanism:

Additionally, the function get_req_len_dict generates a dictionary mapping document identifiers to their respective lengths. This likely aids in determining optimal chunk sizes, ensuring efficient summarization.
The dataset reading process is integral to preprocessing and ensures data integrity for downstream tasks.

**3. Chunking-Based Approach**

3.1. Need for Chunking
Transformer models, including BART, have a fixed token limit (e.g., 1024 tokens for facebook/bart-large-cnn). For documents exceeding this limit:
•	Direct processing is infeasible.
•	Splitting the text into smaller chunks ensures compatibility with the model while maintaining information flow.

3.2. Chunking Process
•	Texts are divided into logical segments based on:
o	Sentence boundaries.
o	Token limits.
o	Semantic units (e.g., paragraphs or sections).
•	Each chunk is processed independently by the BART model to generate partial summaries.

3.3. Reassembly
•	The generated summaries for individual chunks are concatenated to produce the final summary.
•	This step may involve additional processing, such as removing redundancy or ensuring grammatical coherence.
